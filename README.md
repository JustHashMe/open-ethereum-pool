# open-pirl-pool
Open Pirl Mining Pool

The concept for this project is to make a very simple auto installer based off of open ethereum pool.

Given the prereq's are met, (an installation of Ubuntu 16 LTS and an internet connection) Users should be able to run the shell script
with minimal to no effort.

Theoretically, the script will ask for required variables after initial dependency installation.

The user will input desired information and the shell script will do everything else.
